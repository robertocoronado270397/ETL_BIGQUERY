To create an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process in Python that sends data to a dataset in BigQuery, you'll need to follow these steps:

Install the necessary libraries.
Set up your Google Cloud Platform (GCP) project and create a dataset in BigQuery.
Set up your authentication credentials.
Write a Python script to extract, transform, and load the data.

Here's a detailed explanation of each step:

1.  Install the necessary libraries.

```
pip install google-cloud-bigquery pandas

```

2.  Set up your Google Cloud Platform (GCP) project and create a dataset in BigQuery
3.  Set up your authentication credentials
4.  Write a Python script to extract, transform, and load the data

Replace the placeholders with your actual file paths, GCP project ID, dataset ID, and table ID, and customize the transformation and schema as needed for your use case.
